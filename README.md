# Agricultural-Plant-Classification-Evaluation-Test

**Description:**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for an evaluation test on agricultural plant classification. It covers:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, scaling, and encoding.
- Data Visualization: Gaining insights and identifying patterns.
- Testing Classification Algorithms: Using decision trees, random forests, SVM, k-NN, and others.
- Evaluating Predictions: Assessing accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.
- Comparing Methods: Determining the best-performing classification algorithm.
